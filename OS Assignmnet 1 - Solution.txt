Assignment 1

Problem 1: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is
any need to insert some data then do that as well. 

a) Navigate and List:
a. Start by navigating to your home directory and list its contents. Then, move into a
directory named "LinuxAssignment" if it exists; otherwise, create it. 
Solution : ls --> to navigate through home dirctory
           mkdir LinuxAssignmnent --> to create  new LinuxAssignmnent directory inside home directory


b) File Management:
a. Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its
contents
Solution : touch file1.txt --> to cfreate file1.txt file
           cat file1.txt --> to dsiplay the content of file1.txt

c) Directory Management:
a. Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory.
Solution : mkdir docs --> to  create new directory docs inside LinuxAssignmnet directory 

d) Copy and Move Files:
a. Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt". 
Solution : cp file1.txt docs --> to copy file1.txt in docs directory
            cd docs --> tochange dirctory to docs
            ls --> to see whether file1.txt is copied inside docs directory or not
            mv file1.txt file2.txt --> to rename file1.txt to file2.txt

e) Permissions and Ownership:
a. Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute permissions for
the owner and only read permissions for others. Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to
the current user. 

Solution : ls -n or ls -l --> checked the read,write and execute. it was already for read for other user so no need of change if need to change then, --> "chmod u+rwx g+r-wx o+r-wx file2.txt"

f) Final Checklist:
a. Finally, list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory and the root directory to
ensure that all operations were performed correctly. 
Solution : chown cdac file2.txt --> to change ownership of "file2.txt" to user cdac
            pwd --> to check the the directory path
            cd .. --> to go in LinuxAssignment directory
            ls --> to display content of LinuxAssignment directory

g) File Searching:
a. Search for all files with the extension ".txt" in the current directory and its subdirectories.
b. Display lines containing a specific word in a file (provide a file name and the specific
word to search).
Solution : find -name "*txt" --> to display all the text files present in current directory and other subdirectories.
           cat > file1.txt --> to edit the content of file after entering the content press ctrl+D to get to command line 
           grep "hello" file1.txt --> after entring some content in file i put this coomand to search which has "hello" word in it and      display it.

h) System Information:
a. Display the current system date and time.
Solution : date --> to display system current date
            date "+%T" --> to display time

i) Networking:
a. Display the IP address of the system.
b. Ping a remote server to check connectivity (provide a remote server address to ping). 
Solution : hostname -I --> to display ip address
           ping www.google.com --> it pinged google.com contunosly then i had to search the command to get out of it it was ctrl+C

 File Compression:
a. Compress the "docs" directory into a zip file.
b. Extract the contents of the zip file into a new directory. 
Solution : zip -r docs.zip docs --> to create zip file of docs directory
           sudo apt install zip --> i had to install zip  command to use it asked for password and some extra storage on system and continue to install after installation i zipped docs file
           unzip docs.zip -d new_docs --> to unzip/ extract the content of the docs.zip into new_docs directory

k) File Editing:
a. Open the "file1.txt" file in a text editor and add some text to it.
b. Replace a specific word in the "file1.txt" file with another word (provide the original
word and the word to replace it with). 
Solution : sed -i 's/hello/world/g' file1.txt --> file1.txt already had hello world. I, replaced hello-->world so i became world world.
           cat file1.txt --> to display the file1.txt file to see changes and "hello world" beacame "world world"

Problem 2: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is
any need to insert some data then do that as well.

a. Suppose you have a file named "data.txt" containing important information. Display the
first 10 lines of this file to quickly glance at its contents using a command. 
Solution : mkdir Assignment2--> make directory
           cd Assignment2 --> change directory
           cat > data.txt --> create text file and enter data in it
           head data.txt --> used for displaing first 10 line in the terminal

b. Now, to check the end of the file for any recent additions, display the last 5 lines of
"data.txt" using another command. 
Solution : tail -n 5 data.txt --> used for displaying last 5 lines of the data enter in the file

c. In a file named "numbers.txt," there are a series of numbers. Display the first 15 lines of
this file to analyze the initial data set. 
Solution : cat > numbers.txt --> create text file and enter data in it from 1 to 15
           head -n 15 numbers.txt --> used for displaing first 15 line in the terminal

d. To focus on the last few numbers of the dataset, display the last 3 lines of "numbers.txt".
Solution : tail -n 3 data.txt --> used for displaying last 3 lines of the data enter in the file

e. Imagine you have a file named "input.txt" with text content. Use a command to translate
all lowercase letters to uppercase in "input.txt" and save the modified text in a new file
named "output.txt." 
Solution: cat > input.txt --> create text file and enter text (in lower case)
          tr a-z A-Z < input.txt --> translate all the lower case words to uppercase
          tr a-z A-Z < input.txt > output.txt --> changeing name from input to output

f. In a file named "duplicate.txt," there are several lines of text, some of which are
duplicates. Use a command to display only the unique lines from "duplicate.txt." 
Solution :cat > duplicate.txt --> used for making text file name 'duplicate'
          uniq duplicate.txt --> used for displaying content which are repeated

g. In a file named "fruit.txt," there is a list of fruits, but some fruits are repeated. Use a
command to display each unique fruit along with the count of its occurrences in
"fruit.txt.
Solution : cat > fruit.txt --> used for making text file of 'fruit' name
           uniq -c fruit.txt --> for displaying repeated fruits with no. of times it has appeared 
           uniq -c fruit.txt | cut -c7-  ---> for displaying repeated fruits with no. of times it has appeared with cutting the 7 spaces appeared in front of common elements
